# Reference prediction with random study effects to include single-arm studies 
# Uses 1 covariate
# Have to use a model file in order to use the dnorm(,)I(,) syntax to truncate priors on sd in disconnected evidence

# Uses 'cut()' to prevent feedback from single-arm studies to baseline model

# Data are same as TSD format: ns, nt, na, r, n, t
# The data on baseline arms (from RCTs) are
# ns.base : number of baseline arms
# r.base : number of events in baseline arms
# n.base : number of patients in baseline arms
# The data on single arm studies are:
# ns.single : number of single arm studies
# r.single : number of events in single arm studies
# n.single : number of patients in single arm studies
# t.single : treatment in single arm study

# sd.connected.mean and sd.connected.tau are the mean and precision of the sd in the connected components.
# These are used as informative priors on sd.disc in the random effects models

# Binomial likelihood, logit link 
# Simultaneous baseline and treat effects model for multi-arm trials 
# Includes single-arm studies
